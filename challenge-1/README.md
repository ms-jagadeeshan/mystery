## üßê Challange explanation <a name = "about"></a>

This program takes inputs of two variables in the file called 'input.txt' and performs the additiion,subraction and some other operations also
<br>
When we run the main program it takes to menu, lets say you choose addition , then it gives two options for you
<br>
1)To show results in output console
<br>
2) Export as file
<br>

You can choose whatever you want.Export works for addition.
<br>
But when select subraction and choose to export as file it gives error  and eventhough when you choose 'to show results', it show the values in output console

For division also export not works.
Find the bug and solve that error.
